#+TITLE: Carleton Placement Exam solution

A solver for the [[http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/placement/problem.pdf][Carleton placement exam]].

Code is separated into multiple files for readability.
The shared code to find the quad sequences is put into the ~grid~ class in [[file:shared.py]].
Grid is (fully) unit tested in [[file:test_grid.py]].

* Usage
  As per the expected behavior in the document

  (needs to be run with python 3.6 because of the use of [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/][fstring]])

  #+begin_src shell :eval no
    $ python3 -V
    # Python 3.6
    $ python3 solution.py <url>
  #+end_src

** Options

   - url :: the URL that contains the grid

** Examples

   #+begin_src shell :eval no
     $ python3 solution.py http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/placement/grid.txt
   #+end_src

* Implementation notes
  
  what needs to be done:
  1. ingest the file
  2. put into two dimensional array
  3. create functions to nicely access said array
  4. find all the quad sequences
     - vertical
     - horizontal
     - up diagonal
     - down diagonal
  5. calculate all the quad sequences and their products
  6. place those in a map with the key being the product and the value a vector
     of the numbers to calculate the product
  7. find largest product and then print it out

* Code

** Shared Grid code

   implementation:
   #+include: "./shared.py" src python -n

   unit test:
   #+include: "./test_grid.py" src python -n

** First attempt

   uses a brute force method
   #+include: "./attempt1.py" src python -n
