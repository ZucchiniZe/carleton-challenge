* Implementation notes
  
  what needs to be done:
  1. ingest the file
  2. put into two dimensional array
  3. create functions to nicely access said array
  4. find all the quad sequences
     - vertical
     - horizontal
     - up diagonal
     - down diagonal
  5. calculate all the quad sequences and their products
  6. place those in a map with the key being the product and the value a vector
     of the numbers to calculate the product
  7. find largest product and then print it out
